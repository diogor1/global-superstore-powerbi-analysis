## 💡 Key Insights

- **Technology Leads in Sales:** Among all product categories, Technology consistently generated the highest sales. This could be due to higher unit prices and increasing demand for tech-related products across markets.
- **Profitability Varies by Category:** While Technology had the highest sales, its profit margins were not always the highest. Some Office Supplies products had surprisingly strong profit ratios despite lower sales volumes.
- **Top Performing Countries:** India and the USA stood out as the top two countries in terms of total revenue. India's growth trend was especially notable in the last quarter, suggesting a potential emerging market for future focus.
- **Discounts Impact Profit:** Categories with higher discounts often had lower profit margins. A careful balance is needed between promotional discounts and overall profitability.
- **Sales Spike in Q4:** There was a noticeable sales spike in the final quarter of each year, likely driven by seasonal events, promotions, or end-of-year procurement patterns in corporate segments.
- **Shipping Mode Preference:** Standard Class was the most commonly used shipping mode, hinting at customer preference for cost-saving options over faster delivery.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This Power BI project was a hands-on opportunity to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights. I learned how to build a clear and interactive report using slicers, KPI cards, bar charts, and time-based trends.

By analyzing multiple business dimensions — like country, product category, and customer segment — I was able to uncover trends that would help stakeholders make smarter decisions.

This experience sharpened my data storytelling skills and strengthened my understanding of Power BI’s modeling and visualization tools. It’s only the beginning of my data visualization journey, and I look forward to solving more complex problems with clearer visual communication.
